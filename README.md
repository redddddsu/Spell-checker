## About

I stumbled across a very interesting video that explains the history and how spell checkers work. Just from learning how the algorithm works, I decided to challenge myself to see if I could make it myself.

This was also around the time I was learning Github and good coding practices. So I made separate folders for source, headers, and data and used things like Cmake and .gitignore. 

As for why there is a web scraper, finding a text file of the entire dictionary on the internet was actually quite hard. So I just searched for a random dictionary website and scraped it. I also excluded some words with special symbols because they might make the result look weird.
